Conventions
==============================

Data Models
---------------
- Data Models are implemented in individual files. models.py is reserved for small / auxiliary models. Closely related models are implemented in the same file.
- model fields: use machine readable format (no positional argument to define human readable name)

URL's
--------------------
- URL REST structure (TODO)
