**Equinox** is an open source platform for sustainable portfolio management. Equinox implements and integrates a number of regulatory or industry standards that cover the space of GHG emissions attribution and reporting and ESG risk analysis.

These pages serve as the online documentation of the equinox platform.

The full list of implemented standards is in :ref:`References`

.. note:: The equinox project is still in its development phase and is not yet suitable for production deployments. Feel free to contact us for the roadmap and any requests / feedback.
