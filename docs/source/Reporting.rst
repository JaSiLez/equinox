Reporting
------------------------------

The Objectives and Results Explorer provides the functionality for extracting business information from the Equinox system. This page provides a basic introduction. Further information is available in the user manuals

The type of analysis and reporting provided in this section is linked to the objectives set out in the Sustainable Portfolio Management mandate. In its simplest, the end point of an interaction with Equinox is the production of a set of numbers (a Report) about various aspects of the portfolio.

Working with visual data may also lead to graphical reports. More complex reports will involve composite workflows and storage of results which may lead to specifications of risk profile assessment for an entity, optimization options etc.

Creating useful outcomes / reports is linked to specific use cases. Still under construction</p>
