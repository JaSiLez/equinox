Dependencies / Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: A Linux based system is recommended but with minor tweaks it is in principle also possible to deploy in Windows systems

- equinox requires a working Python 3 installation (including pip)
- Python >= 3.9
- Django >= 4.0
- The precise python library dependencies are listed in the :doc:`requirements`.txt file.
- equinox may work with earlier versions of these packages but this has not been tested
