Project
------------------------------

The Project model is the fundamental building block for many Equinox workflows. It is a container for a discrete portfolio management action. It may represent an evaluation workflow following the GHG Protocol for Projects. It may be a fully fledged financing structure for Project Finance. Or, for example, a procurement contract.

A Project expresses the intentions and objectives of the portfolio manager and is distinct from specific Assets (Facilities, Buildings, Supplies), Contracts (Loans, Procurement Contracts) and Counterparties (Borrowers, Contractors etc).
