The PCAF Workflow of Mortgages
---------------------------------------

The PCAF Methodology for Mortgages is an *attribution* and *reporting* methodology for Residential Mortgage Portfolios


The following steps replicate the PCAF workflow for Mortgages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Insert Mortgage Loans that are part of Portfolio. Critical Fields
    - Asset Class (Residential)
    - Total Balance

- Insert Real Estate that Backs Mortgages. Critical Fields
    - Asset Class (Residential)
    - Initial Valuation Amount

- Emissions Sources. Critical Fields
    - Asset Reference

- If data are not available for an emission category (sub-sector/scope), notation keys should be used. Select the appropriate notation key from the drop-down list.
- Next, you will be asked to enter activity data. If the units are different to the denominator of the emission factor used, use the activity data multiplier function to convert.
- To use the activity data multiplier, select the unit you wish to convert your activity data into. Alternatively, you can enter your own conversion factor in the override column.
- Select the greenhouse gases included in your calculations from the drop-down list.
- Select an emission factor from the drop-down list. These are the ones you will have defined earlier in the Emission factors sheet. They are shown here in tonnes of CO2e.
- Alternatively, if you do not have an emission factor for a specific activity, you may enter emissions data directly. Make sure this is reported in metric tonnes of CO2e.
- To report emission data directly, select the tick mark (a) from the drop-down list and enter emissions data under the appropriate GHG.
- The tool then calculates emissions based on the data submitted, in metric tonnes of CO2e.
- Assess the quality of your activity data in the Data quality column. Choose from high, medium or low. You can provide an optional explanation in the final column.
- You must also provide a clear description of the methodologies you have used. If you have used a notation key, please provide an explanation.
- Finally, select a data source from the drop-down list which lists all the references you defined in the Data sources sheet.
- Repeat the above process for all emission sources in your mortgage portfolio

- The estimated mortgage portfolio emissions can be found in the Portfolio Status menu under *PCAF Mortgage Report*
