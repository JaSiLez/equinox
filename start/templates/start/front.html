    <h2>Welcome to Equinox</h2>

    <h3>Focus on the challenge of Sustainability in Project Finance context</h3>
    <p>Sustainability (both environmental and social) is a serious and ongoing issue that affects all economies.
        Developing tools and methodologies that improve the ability of all stakeholders to assess and report risks is
        thus an important objective</p>

    <h3>What exactly is Equinox?</h3>
    <p>Equinox is a <i>database and web application</i> that works together with a tailored data schema to provide easy
        access to Project Finance data adhering to the regulatory and ESG initiative recommendations. Running the
        application creates a <i>server</i> that can then be accessed via any regular browser. For easy installation and
        testing the current release uses an sqlite database instead of a production database.</p>

    <p>The initial functionality of Equinox focuses on integrating the following concepts</p>

    <ul>
        <li> The European Banking Authority's Criteria for the Credit Risk Assessment of Project Finance under the
            Standardized approach for Specialized Lending
        </li>
        <li> The PCAF accounting and reporting recommendations for Project Finance GHG emissions</li>
        <li> The Equator Principles</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Once the platform is up and running a wealth of functionality is available.</p>


    <h3>User Functionality</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>A user can log-in into the application with their credentials</li>
        <li>Inspect the available data sets (tables or relations) that capture the EBA / EP / PCAF Data
            requirements
        </li>
        <li>Insert, Update or Delete records (e.g. new Project Data)</li>
        <li>Consult the documentation as to the meaning and requirements of each data element (TODO)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Administrator Functionality</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An administrator can create users and user groups and assign permissions</li>
        <li>Perform bulk insertion or deletion of data sets</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Developer Functionality</h3>
    <ul>
