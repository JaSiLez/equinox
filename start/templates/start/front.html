                    <p>The Equinox platform focus on the challenge of Sustainable Portfolio Management</p>

                    <p>Sustainability (both environmental and social) is a major issue that affects all economies. Developing tools and methodologies that improve the ability of all stakeholders to assess and report risks is an important objective and Equinox aims to help carry out this process as optimally as possible.</p>

                    <p>Equinox is a both <i>a database and a web application</i> that works together with a tailored
                        <i>data schema</i> to provide easy access to sustainability data adhering to both regulatory requirements, protocols and recommendations and financial industry initiatives.

                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>

                <div class="card card-body">
                    <p>Running the application creates a <i>server</i> that can then be accessed via any regular web browser. NB: For easy installation and testing the current release uses a self-contained sqlite database instead of a production database server
                    </p>

                    <p>The initial functionality of Equinox focuses on integrating the following concepts</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Implementing the GHG Protocol for accounting for CO2 emissions via inventories, activities and emission factors</li>
                        <li>The PCAF accounting and reporting framework (currently for Project Finance and Mortgage Finance GHG emissions)</li>
                        <li>Support for Green Public Procurement through the integration of TED data models and associated ontologies</li>
                        <li>Holistic risk management with the integration of the European Banking Authority's Criteria (currently Credit Risk Assessment of Project Finance under the Standardized approach for Specialized Lending)
                        </li>
                        <li>Support for monitoring the Equator Principles for Project Finance</li>
                    </ul>
