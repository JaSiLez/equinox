This page only provides an overview, select specific links for more detailed information",
      "content": "<h3><i class=\"fa fa-cubes\"></i> The overall design </h3>\r\n\r\n<p> Equinox supports multiple sources of databases of credit data. Here is a list of the most important categories</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <a href=\"{{ root_view }}/documentation/Golden_Source_Databases\">\"Golden source\" databases</a> for detailed contract level data\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Templates based on the EBA loan level data templates</li>\r\n<li> Templates based on the ESMA securitisation collateral data templates </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>A simplified and standardized <it>native</it> portfolio database that holds portfolio data the include risk parameters such as PD/LGD/EAD </li>\r\n<li>A synthetic portfolio database that holds arbitrary portfolio specifications for testing and what-if type analyses</li>\r\n<li>Specialized databases for holding non-standard data such as representations of credit networks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-table\"></i> Standardized (Golden Source) Backend </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Equinox has the concept of a \"golden source\" backend (database / warehouse) that holds the most detailed and accurate information about clients and products. The schema (detailed type of information) of the current golden source backend replicates the proposed standards of the European Banking Authority</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We make a distinction between the main backend database and the data collections (views) that are used for various credit portfolio management <i>Objectives</i>. The latter will typically be <i>subsets</i> extracted and collated from the backend sources and further enhanced by applying calculation <i>Workflows</i>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-cubes\"></i> Portfolio Explorer </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Portfolio Explorer is a key interface to the Equinox databases of credit data. In the Portfolio Explorer application we consider a <i>Credit Portfolio</i> as a composite <b>view</b> that integrates both <i>Client</i> specific and <i>Loan Product</i> information. Such views can be generated in various ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>By processing actual credit data from the golden source backend database of Equinox</li>\r\n<li>By importing data from external files or databases</li>\r\n<li>By generating simulated (synthetic) portfolios for training and analysis purposes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Practically every user workflow / objective and desired report in Equinox requires specifying a portfolio to use for analysis. Hence familiarizing with\r\nthe type of data used by the portfolio explorer and how they can be generated or modified is a significant step in making efficient use of the platform</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-scissors\"></i> Synthetic Portfolios</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>Synthetic portfolios are an important way to use Equinox to gain deep portfolio management insights. The key idea is that a synthetic portfolio is not derived explicitly from actual portfolio data but is constructed via a summary specification. This allows the user to explore scenarios in an easy and focused manner </p> \r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-users\"></i> Cyclos Link </h3>\r\n<p>Cyclos Link is an example of generating Client Data aggregations in Equinox through the use of external sources. It creates a direct link to an external instance of the Cyclos Software which allows the construction of <i>Snapshots</i> that are stored within Equinox and can be used for further analysis\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-users\"></i> Client Explorer </h3>\r\n<p>The Client Explorer views focus exclusively on borrowing entities (clients, borrowers, counterparties) and their possible connections. A important future functionality available at the client explorer level will be the credit scoring of clients on the basis of standardized credit scoring models.\r\n</p>",

      "content": "<h3><i class=\"fa fa-cogs\"></i> The Workflow Concept </h3>\r\n<p> Workflows are a powerful means to expose the <b>full</b> functionality of Equinox allowing near limitless customization. Defining new workflows does require higher technical level and familiarity with the platform. But once defined, workflows are the building blocks of <a href=\"{{ root_view }}/documentation/About_Playbooks\">Playbooks</a>. In turn, one or more Playbooks allow you to achieve your Credit Portfolio Management  <a href=\"{{ root_view }}/documentation/About_Objectives\">Objectives</a>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard tasks can usually be achieved easier and faster with the <i>built-in</i> functionalities of the various apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each workflow is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>a specification of a set of input data</li>\r\n<li>the performance of some desired operation / calculations and finally</li>\r\n<li>where applicable, the storage of the output</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-bars\"></i> Workflow Classifications </h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A good way to understand the nature of workflows is to examine some possible classifications:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>By Portfolio Management Objective </h4>\r\n\r\n<p> Workflows can be classified according to the desired portfolio management objective. This classification aims to help use Equinox in the most effective way to perform the portfolio management mandate</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>By Content Type</h4>\r\n\r\n<p> Workflows can also be classified according to the type of content produced. In logical order:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> A <b>Modelling task</b> that performs a customized model calculation. We call modelling workflows simply <i>Workflows</i> as they\r\nare the only type of workflow that actually modifies the Equinox database (creates and inserts new data) </li>\r\n    <li> A <b>Reporting task</b> that produces a customized report for human consumption (e.g. in html or pdf format). We call reporting workflows simply <i>Reports</i></li>\r\n    <li> A <b>Visualization task</b> that produces a customized visualization (either a static graphic or a dynamic visualization offering some embedded interactivity). We call visualization workflows simply <i>Visualizations</i></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>A mentioned above, not all Equinox functionality is available or optimal to use via Workflows. The most important category of tasks currently not available via Workflows are operations modifying the Portfolio databases.\r\n\r\n<h4>By User Interaction Style</h4>\r\n\r\n<p> Finally, workflows can also be classified according to the type of interaction with the user:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> A <b>Batch workflow</b> that performs a calculation and permanently stores the results in the database. This is the recommended mode for formal tasks performed using Equinox. Batch workflows may be a single calculation or a family of operations (for example  a parameter space survey to allow some optimization) and stores the results</li>\r\n    <li> An <b>Interactive workflow</b> that allows <i>interactively</i> working with models and data. This is the recommended mode for exploratory analysis, training and other tasks that require significant experimentation. This mode does not (normally) save results in permanent storage (does not create a log file).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-list\"></i> Modelling workflow Components </h3>\r\n<p> There are four modelling workflow components:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li> The model to be used (currently only one model per calculation) </li>\r\n    <li> The portfolio data to be used </li>\r\n    <li> The model configuration parameters</li>\r\n    <li> The model data parameters </li>\r\n</ul>",

Portfolio specific\r\n    historical credit data and economic timeseries data. The first allows for\r\n    example building credit scoring models, estimating credit quality migration.\r\n    The latter allow building scenarios and simulation engines that can project\r\n    outcomes for the portfolio under different environmental (business) conditions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-dashboard\"></i> About the Economic Data Explorer</h3>\r\n<p>The Economic Data explorer is an interactive, visual application that\r\n    builds on high quality open data repositories. Currently the main link is\r\n    the excellent resource provided by the European Central Bank (ECB)\r\n    via its <a href=\"http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/\">Statistical Data Warehouse</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Explorer retrieves statistical data from the warehouse and\r\n    provides value enhancing <i>visualizations</i> and <i>modelling</i> reports.\r\n    This enables answering the \"what if\" type questions that are essential in stress\r\n    testing business plans and balance sheets against adverse economic scenarios.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n   It is at the moment not possible to use the Economic Data Explorer to directly\r\nbuild a scenario. This will be future functionality.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><i class=\"fa fa-exchange\"></i> Transition Matrix Data</h3>\r\n<p> Functionality for using own historical credit data to build scoring and transition\r\n    models within Equinox will be forthcoming.
