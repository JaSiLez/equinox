The process entails the conversion of a chemically designed and physically prepared raw material mixture into cement clinker. \r\n\r\nIn Company X’s facilities, this is done in a rotary kiln through the controlled combustion of coal.\r\n\r\n## Emissions Sources\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from cement manufacturing depend on the fuel mix, energy consumption, plant technology, and other variables, and are plant-specific. The two main GHG emission sources are:\r\n\r\n* Calcination/pyro-processing, which is generally the largest source of GHG emissions. (CaCO3+ heat = > CaO+CO2 ). The GHG emissions from this source are categorized as industrial process emissions, which can generate 50 percent or more of total cement manufac- turing GHG emissions (OECD/IEA 2000).\r\n* Fuel burning in pyro-processing, which requires flame temperatures above 2,000 ̊C and large quantities of fuels. Depending on the raw materials and the actual production process, a cement plant consumes\r\nfuel at a rate between 3,200 and 5,500 megajoules per tonne (MJ/t) of clinker.",
