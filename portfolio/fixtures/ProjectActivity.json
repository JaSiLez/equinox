Company X proposes to manufacture blended cement, which uses increased proportions of limestone and pozzolan additives in the fine-grinding process. The result is cement with a lower clinker fraction (81 percent) with a strength comparable to that of OPC. \r\n\r\nLowering the clinker-to-cement ratio reduces both process emissions and associated fuel-related GHG emissions. \r\n\r\nThe pozzolanic additives used include coal fly ash and volcanic ash (trass). The use of these materials will require investment in new equipment to improve clinker\r\nquality. With its existing equipment, Company X can only slightly reduce its clinker-to-cement ratio (from 95 percent to 91 percent).",
